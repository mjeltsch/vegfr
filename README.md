Phylogenetic tree of VEGF receptors

This quick analysis is similar to Bussmann et al. (2008) in their Figure 1A (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000064).
However, this updated analysis 
* has much better coverage
* only uses species for which all VEGF receptor sequences are available
* shows comprehensive bootstrap values
